Juan M. Gandarias is an Assistant Professor at the [Systems Engineering and Automation Department](https://www.uma.es/isa) at the [University of Malaga](https://www.uma.es), Spain, where he conducts his research in the [Robotics and Mechatronics Lab](https://www.uma.es/robotics-and-mechatronics). Previously, he received his B.S. degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Malaga, Spain, in 2015 with a spezialization in Robotics, Automation and Control. He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Malaga in 2017 and 2020, respectively. During his PhD he was a Ph.D. visitor at the [Soft Haptics & Robotics Lab](https://helge-wurdemann.com/softhapticslab/) at the [University College London](https://ucl.ac.uk). Lately, from 2020 to 2023, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Human-Robot Interfaces and Interaction](https://www.iit.it/web/hrii/) group at [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia](https://www.iit.it) (IIT), where he was a researcher in the Horizon-2020 project [SOPHIA](https://project-sophia.eu/), ERC project [Ergo-Lean](https://ergolean.eu/), and the Real-Move project awarded with an ERC-POC grant. During his time in IIT he also participated in other projects, and academic and technology transfer initiatives. He has also contributed to several Spanish, Italian and European research projects related to search-and-rescue, physical robotic assistance, and Human-Robot Collaboration in Industrial environments. He is the author of several publications in flagship international journals and conferences in the fields of robotics and automation. He is also the inventor of one international patent. He has contributed as academic editor of special issues in scientific journals, conferences and international workshops. He has served as a reviewer for high-relevance journals and conferences such as IEEE RAM, RA-L, ICRA, IROS, ToH, or RCIM among others.
