abstract: <div align="justify">In this work, we presented a prototype of the omnilateral walking support robotic system and we designed an admittance controller based on the interaction force measured on the pelvis of the user. In further work, we will focus on optimizing the parameters of the controller to improve movement transparency. In addition, we will improve the stability of walking, for example, balancing and preventing falls.</div>
