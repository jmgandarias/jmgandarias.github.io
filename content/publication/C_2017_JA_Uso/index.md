abstract: This paper presents the experience of the educational use of a haptic device developed as a new version of the Haptic Paddle, created at Stanford University in the mid 90's. It is a low-cost and simple educational device that can be assembled and programmed by students, and was used for teaching system dynamics. The design uses fully oﬀ-the-shelf electronics, standard metric bearings and hardware, and parts fabricated using 3D printing. This paper presents this device together with the experience of its teaching use, by means of project-based learning, in a mechatronics engineering master's degree course. This is the first experience with a total of eight haptic paddle kits in the subject of Teleoperation and Telerobotics, together with project-based learning (PBL) and the use of modeling languages. The organization and development of the practice sessions are described, with conclusions on the suitability of the devices and methods used.
