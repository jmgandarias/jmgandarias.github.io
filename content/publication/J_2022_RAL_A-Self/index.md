abstract: <div align="justify">This paper presents a novel interaction planning method that exploits impedance tuning techniques in response
to environmental uncertainties and unpredictable conditions
using haptic information only. The proposed algorithm plans
the robotâ€™s trajectory based on the haptic interaction with the
environment and adapts planning strategies as needed. Two
approaches are considered. Exploration and Bouncing strategies.
The Exploration strategy takes the actual motion of the robot
into account in planning, while the Bouncing strategy exploits the
forces and the motion vector of the robot. Moreover, self-tuning
impedance is performed according to the planned trajectory to
ensure compliant contact and low contact forces. In order to show
the performance of the proposed methodology, two experiments
with a torque-controller robotic arm are carried out. The first
considers a maze exploration without obstacles, whereas the
second includes obstacles. The proposed method performance is
analyzed and compared against previously proposed solutions
in both cases. Experimental results demonstrate that. i) the
robot can successfully plan its trajectory autonomously in the
most feasible direction according to the interaction with the
environment, and ii) a compliant interaction with an unknown
environment despite the uncertainties is achieved. Finally, a
scalability demonstration is carried out to show the potential
of the proposed method under multiple scenarios.</div>
