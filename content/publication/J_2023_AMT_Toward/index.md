abstract: <div align="justify">Electronics and mechatronics waste is an exponentially increasing environmental issue, especially for wearable devices, due to their widespread diffusion into society and short life cycle. To promote their enormous benefits (e.g., in assisting visually impaired individuals) in a sustainable way, biobased and/or biodegradable organic materials should be used instead of traditional components. This manuscript presents a multidisciplinary approach, which bridges materials science and mechatronics, to propose the first ECO-friendly wearable vibroTACtile device (Eco-Tac). The design of Eco-Tac includes integration on a cotton t-shirt through a novel biodegradable conductive ink forming electrical tracks, a flexible commercially available solar panel, and the vibrotactile haptic device itself. The ink comprises a green solvent, anisole, a soft polybutylene adipate terephthalate biodegradable binder, and conductive nanocarbon materials. The device case is a biodegradable biocomposite. As such, the feasibility of using a sustainable energy source to supply power to the device and the possibility of using biodegradable materials in its manufacturing are demonstrated. An experiment with 20 blindfolded subjects is conducted, reporting the device's potential for assistance in manipulation tasks. Overall, the results of this work represent the first significant step toward the creation of wearable and sustainable haptic devices with green electronics and mechatronics approaches.</div>
