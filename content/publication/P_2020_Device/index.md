abstract: <div align="justify">The invention relates to a device (100), system and method for controllable fastening using a mechanical arm (200), wherein the device (100) comprises at least two foldable levers (110) joined together by means of a shaft (130) and by means of at least one elastic element (140). The foldable levers are configured to rotate relative to the shaft (130) between a first position and a second position when pressed by the mechanical arm (200). In the first position, the elastic element (140) is located at a first side of the shaft (130), such that the tension of the elastic element (140) presses the foldable levers (110) against the mechanical arm (200). In the second position, the elastic element (140) is located at a second side of the shaft (130), such that the tension of the elastic element (140) keeps the foldable levers (110) in the second position, without making contact with the mechanical arm (200), and securing means fasten the device (100) to a body (300).</div>
