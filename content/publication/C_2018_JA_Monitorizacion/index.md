abstract: <div align="justify">This paper presents the first victim monitoring device for automatic placement of victims with aerial robotic manipulators. It is a distributed sensory system for the continuous assessment of the health status of catastrophic casualties. The designed sensor and communication system are described, as well as the application through the placement of the sensor based on the use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) or aerial manipulator robots. The continuous monitoring device offers advantages over the current triage systems as it allows for online data collection and health status assesstment. It collects vital signs measurements from the victims, which are published through Internet of Things (IoT) protocols that allow them to be processed remotely. In addition, it has methods based on deep learning for the automatic detection of the relative position of the wrist of a person arm with respect to the aerial manipulator. Preliminary experiments have been carried out to obtain measurements and sensor placement using a preliminary prototype of the sensor.</div>
