abstract: <div align="justify">The objective of this paper is to develop and evaluate a directional vibrotactile feedback interface as a guidance tool for postural adjustments during work. In contrast to the existing active and wearable systems such as exoskeletons, we aim to create a lightweight and intuitive interface, capable of guiding its wearers towards more ergonomic and healthy working conditions. To achieve this, a vibrotactile device called ErgoTac is employed to develop three diﬀerent feedback modalities that are able to provide a directional guidance at the body segments towards a desired pose. In addition, an evaluation is made to ﬁnd the most suitable, comfortable, and intuitive feedback modality for the user. Therefore, these modalities are ﬁrst compared experimentally on ﬁfteen subjects wearing eight ErgoTac devices to achieve targeted arm and torso conﬁgurations. The most eﬀective directional feedback modality is then evaluated on ﬁve subjects in a set of experiments in which an ergonomic optimisation module provides the optimised body posture while performing heavy lifting or forceful exertion tasks. The results yield strong evidence on the usefulness and the intuitiveness of one of the developed modalities in providing guidance towards ergonomic working conditions, by minimising the eﬀect of an external load on body joints. We believe that the integration of such low-cost devices in workplaces can help address the well-known and complex problem of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.</div>
