This page provides comprehensive information about my teaching activities, including teaching materials and thesis supervision.

The teaching materials available here are entirely developed by me, drawing extensively on the foundational work of many (very many) people. I have tried my best to acknowledge and cite the sources that have informed the creation of this content. If you believe your work (or someone elese's) should have been referenced but has not, please let me know.

Below, in this order, there's a list of the courses I have taught throughout my academic career, some teaching material with links to their respective websites, and the theses I have supervised.
